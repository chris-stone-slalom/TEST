# Python Project Setup

This repository is now configured for Python learning and experimentation.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Python installed (recommend Python 3.10+).
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies as needed using pip.

## Project Structure
- Place your Python scripts and modules in the root or in a `src/` directory.
- Use the `.genai/context/` folders to document architecture, decisions, requirements, and plans.

## Learning Resources
- Add notes, experiments, and sample code as you learn.
